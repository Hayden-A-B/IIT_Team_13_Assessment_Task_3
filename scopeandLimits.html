        <p>There are two fundamental aspects of ToDoTopia that are required to for a minimum viable product (MVP).</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Completion of a rudimentary game engine that can show case the basis of:
                <ol>
                    <li>Game play of the computer game </li>
                    <li>Cloud based Web application used for hosting the game</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>API connection between work in progress (WIP) application and ToDoTopia. For a MVP to be completed the
                following Scope and limits will need to be adhered to. </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <div class="panel">
        <div class="Game">
            <p>ToDoTopia is a games platform and will ultimately have the potential to host many games. However, it is
                important that for the sake of Scope that we limit the development for now, to just one game.
                Additionally due to time constraints the game should be limited in its functionality until the API and
                Web platform have been developed to MVP.
                <br> is proposed that the game be limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1v1 player</li>
                <li>One Game Map </li>
                <li>Limited number of units in the game
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infantry unit</li>
                        <li>Tank unit</li>
                        <li>Commando unit</li>
                        <li>Scout unit</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Units that survive a battle can be used in the next Game however, players will need to expend XP to
                    repair battle damage units before the next battle. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's temping to develop the game further as this is the “fun” part of what Team Thirteen is doing but
                we need to be able to show a product that works in a short space of time. Further iterations could
                greatly develop the game to include more units 2v2 and 3v3 player, new maps and units that survive
                the battle can gain experience (e.g., More resilient, better weapons etc). However, for the sake of
                MVP and eliminating scope creep the game play will be limited to the above. </p>

    <button class="accordion">Web application and API link: </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <div class="webApi">
            <p>It is proposed that the ToDoTopia cloud-based web platform be limited to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Administration area for mangers</li>
                <li>User Area </li>
                <li>Army Builder</li>
                <li>Users Army (show current units and unit health and cost to repair a battle worn unit to full health)
                </li>
                <li>Leader Board (this could be taken out if time is limited)</li>
                <li>Story Point Conversion (sp to xp)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is proposed that the API connection be limited to one application, Microsoft’s Azure DevOps, using
                their Kanban Board.
                We will need to be able to configure the Jira story cards/tasks to that the story points correlate
                to the number of Xp points in the game. Looking at Azure Documentation it seems the API JSON will
                allow story points to come through <a
                    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work-items/get-work-items-batch?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0">here</a>
            </p>
            <div class="zoom">
            <img  id="storyPoints" src="Images/storypoints.PNG"></div>
            <p>This should allow us to isolate the story pints to convert to Xp for the game. There is a lot of metadata
                that we could pull though from the API but for the sake of MVP it is prudent to limit development to the
                story points, however it might be prudent to develop the data base to include all the metadata for
                future use. At this point displaying the Xp in the Kanban Board world require permissions and extra work
                which is not necessary as Xp can be viewed in the ToDoTopia Web UI. Additionally, calculation of Xp will
                need to be done in the TodoTopia backend logic.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Future Scope</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <div class="futureScope">
            <p>Some of the elements of the future scope of the game have already been pointed out with various game
                upgrades and perhaps rolling out several games’ players can choose from. It is important to point out
                that the ToDoTopia platform could be developed further to include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>employee metrics so that managers can better assess teams and individuals</li>
                <li>rewards points, connection to frequent flyer points, Woolworths rewards or flybys would further
                    incentivise employees with respect to WIP. Not only could Xp be exchanged for buying units bit there
                    could also be an exchange for rewards points. Additionally, Rewards points could be given as prizes
                    in the game for winners of battle rounds or leader board positions. Further incentivising WIP.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For now, these are out of scope as the focus is limited to getting the platform working. However, with
                the correct approach Rewards pints could be added provided the relevant API’s are available. </p>
