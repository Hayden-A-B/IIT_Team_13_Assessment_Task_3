                        ToDoTopia's concept is to use APIs to connect workplace productivity, work in progress, and time tracking apps to our video game. Jira's Kanban Board will be the first application we link to. We'll utilise JSON to link task progress, status, weight, and which people are responsible for completing them. If ToDoTopia was to be created the tools and software required would be.

                        Unity Pro (premium version) is a lot more advanced than Unity Hub; it lets you to start from scratch and contains a lot more critical capabilities for game development, such as

                        Visual Studio is available in three different versions: Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Professional, and Visual Studio Enterprise. Enterprise is the best tier of service because it includes more advanced testing tools, advanced debugging and diagnostics, better Collaboration Tools and Features, and advanced Cross-platform Development tools.

                        Although Postman is a free API, there are premium versions available that can enhance your experience with the app. For up to three people, Postman (Free) offers all the core tooling as well as collaboration.

Postman (Professional) adds single sign-on (SAML), 90-day collection recovery, basic roles and permissions, private workspaces, static IP addresses for API testing, 5 custom domains, 100 calls to the Postman API, and 50 integrations to the basic functionality.

                        To summarise, all the software required to create ToDoTopia has free versions, but there are also professional versions that require a licence and will provide a greater experience in creating ToDoTopia.
