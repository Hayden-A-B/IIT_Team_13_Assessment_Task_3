            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>ToDoTopia is a web-based, games platform that links into companies’ productivity tools to determine
                in-game
                XP. Being a web-based application allows for more flexibility as it is easier to release updates and
                users
                are not required to install an application on their personal computer. Our original idea was to create a
                productivity tool that possessed gamification features, but after some research we decided to focus on
                making a more engaging gaming experience that links into already popular productivity tools, rather than
                focusing on building a productivity tool. Our goal for this platform is to create a more fun and
                competitive
                work environment by turning completed tasks into XP that can be used to buy troops, guns and other
                equipment
                in a real-time strategy (RTS) game. We want to encourage a time at the end of each week or sprint for
                employees to sit down, have a drink and verse each other in a battle that is highly influenced by the
                level
                of productivity of each individual during that week or sprint.<br><br>

                To link into productivity tools used by our customers (such as Jira and Azure DevOps) will require the
                use
                of an API. We will use this API to send across information related to the task such as its difficulty,
                size
                and who completes it. In ToDoTopia’s game, XP will be used to purchase troops, guns, tanks, etc.
                ToDoTopia
                will use the information received about the task to translate it to in-game XP. The task’s size will be
                used
                to determine how much XP the user will receive and the employee who completes the task or moves it to
                the
                next stage of progress will be awarded this XP. The overall outcome of this project is to create a
                web-based
                game’s platform that uses data from a company’s task manager (e.g., Jira or Azure DevOps) to allow
                employees
                to gain in-game XP by completing more tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p class="motivation">Gamification of tasks is not necessarily a new idea. Companies such as <a
                    href="https://habitica.com/static/home">Habitica</a> have been doing it for a
                while now in a way of making your daily tasks and activities rewarding by giving you a character who
                starts
                at level one and has no items. The idea is that you self-appoint yourself tasks and as you complete
                those
                tasks you are rewarded with better equipment to help your character progress. However, these
                applications
                are more on an individual basis and the game play is limited. Keeping a team motivated during a project
                can
                be difficult, but gamification has shown to keep the attention of employees and increase their
                productivity.
                What is gamification? Gamification at its core is turning work into play. There is a model known as
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Qjuegtiyc">Octalysis</a> that explains in detail the eight
                core drives that gamify something whether it be a task at
                work
                or a video game.<br><br>
                <strong>These eight core drives are as listed below:</strong> <br><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Epic Meaning and calling: </strong>“When a player believes that he is doing something
                    greater
                    than himself.”
                    (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Development and Accomplishment: </strong>“The internal drive of making progress, developing
                    skills, and
                    eventually overcoming challenges.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment and Creativity: </strong>“When users are engaged in a creative process where
                    they
                    have to repeatedly
                    figure things out and try different combinations.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral
                    Design)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ownership and Possession: </strong>“Where users are motivated because they feel like they
                    own
                    something. When a
                    player feels ownership, she innately wants to make what she owns better and own even more.” (Yu-kai
                    Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Social Influence and Relatedness: </strong>‘’This drive incorporates all the social elements
                    that drive people,
                    including: mentorship, acceptance, social responses, companionship, as well as competition and envy.
                    When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become
                    driven
                    to reach the same level” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Scarcity and Impatience: </strong>“The drive of wanting something because you can’t have it.
                    Many games have
                    Appointment Dynamics (come back 2 hours later to get your reward) – the fact that people can’t get
                    something right now motivates them to think about it all day long.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp;
                    Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Unpredictability: </strong>“Generally, this is a harmless drive of wanting to find out what
                    will
                    happen next.
                    If you don’t know what’s going to happen, your brain is engaged, and you think about it often. Many
                    people watch movies or read novels because of this drive. However, this drive is also the primary
                    factor
                    behind gambling addiction.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Loss and Avoidance: </strong>“Based upon the avoidance of something negative happening.”
                    (Yu-kai
                    Chou:
                    Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>

                <p>Every good game consists of these eight properties, and they can be used to motivate people and keep
                    them
                    focused. This is the motivation for ToDoTopia, to use gamification to turn completing tasks in a

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>The idea of gamifying tasks is already out there, and applications have been made that use this. <a
                    href="https://habitica.com/static/home">Habitica</a>
                is a habit tracking and task management app. It gamifies completing tasks and practicing habits by
                assigning tasks with gold. This gold is used to build up an avatar and a team can “battle” monsters by
                completing more tasks and habits. The “battle” in Habitica, however, does not require any gameplay,
                rather every day the monster is damaged until its health runs out.
                Other apps such as Todoist and Forest incorporate gamification into their app designs. Todoist is a
                well-known task manager for individuals and teams. It possesses gamification in the form of “Karma” and
                “Karma Levels”. As tasks are complete, the user obtains “Karma”, a form of XP or points, that builds up
                levels. Although Todoist is gamified, it doesn’t possess any true gameplay. Forest is a time-tracking
                application built for setting a timer when working on a particular task. Its gamification is in the form
                of an animated forest where each tree is a timer session. When a timer is completed, a tree is grown in
                the forest, but when the timer is stopped halfway through the session a dead tree is added to the
                forest.
                What ToDoTopia is offering that is different from all these apps, and any other application made with a
                similar purpose, is gameplay. ToDoTopia itself isn’t a task manager, or a Kanban board, but a web-based
                gaming platform allowing for actual gameplay. Actual gameplay is far more engaging than adding armour to
                an avatar or growing trees in a forest. Since our focus is on gameplay, we can create better games that
                link into already great productivity tools.

            <h1>Detailed Description</h1>
            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>The aim is to build a web-based application called ToDoTopia that links into workplace productivity, work
                in progress and time tracking applications to gamify Individual employee and team workloads. The main
                aim is to incentivize teams, help increase productivity, and to create a productive and competitive
                working environment. There are many goals we must work towards and achieve to fulfil our aim. The most
                important and crucial parts of our project can be put into goals. The main goals are to create the game,
                keeping employees motivated, where to host it and applying it to a web application. The creation of the
                game can be split up into smaller goals such as coding it on unity and also how we create the
                fundamentals of the game, so it provides a positive impact to the employees. These are the main goals,
                getting these up and running is of most importance, then we can hone down onto smaller goals for example
                fine tuning the game. </p>

            <h2>Creating the game</h2>
            <p>Creating the game is one of the biggest goals, it can be broken down into smaller goals based around the
                model known as Octalysis. Octalysis explains in detail the eight core drives that gamify something
                whether
                it be a task at work or a video game. These eight core drives are, Epic Meaning and calling, Development
                and
                Accomplishment, Empowerment and Creativity, Ownership and Possession, Social Influence and Relatedness,
                Scarcity and Impatience, Unpredictability and Loss and Avoidance. When creating the game our goal will
                be to
                include these eight properties. The goal is to create a real-time strategy game (RTS) where opponents
                play
                off against each other with their armies. Teams of three would be the aim, so games of 3v3, 2v2 or 1v1.
                We
                chose this as the thought of annihilating your co-worker(s) after a hard week of work would make for a
                great
                team winddown exercise on a Friday afternoon.</p>
            <h2>Keeping employees motivated</h2>
            <p>Another huge goal is to make sure our platform keeps employees motivated, enthused to clear workloads and
                stay in touch with deadlines. By creating the game, we aim to provide a platform for employees to engage
                each other in a social environment. We want the game to provide an outlet for employees to have fun,
                which
                will result in a better, more productive and a more connected workplace. To keep employees motivated we
                will
                implement an experience points system into the game. The goal is to create a system where employees will
                gain Xp when completing tasks, depending on the size of the task determines the amount of Xp acquired.
                Showing how much Xp a task is worth is a good idea so that employees or teams will try and smash out a
                higher-level task to gain this Xp. Xp can be used to buy units in the game. Employees will be trying to
                complete higher tasks as fast as possible to gain more troops than fellow employees, creating an
                efficient
                work environment.
            </p>
            <h2>Web application </h2>
            <p>The goal is to make web application the main platform. We want to It to be a cloud-based application that
                will host the computer game, this will be the main space for ToDoTopia. We will have to choose what to
                host
                It on, such as AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. The goal is to use GameLift cloud-based game
                servers
                which are dedicated for multiplayer games. This will allow us to easily scale depending on how many
                companies are going to employ the game. </p>

            <h2>Do we have enough Time/Recourses?</h2>
            <p>There will be many resources needed to complete this project, along with a lot of time. Most of the time
                will
                be going into the actual creation of the game, as well as where it's going to be hosted and getting our
                name
                out there. I think we will have enough manpower to complete the project. It will come down to if we have
                enough funding to use the cloud services, advertising as well as if we need to employ any IT specialists
                to
                help with the programming of the game, as well as the data side of things. All this will take a lot of
                time,
                it might take longer than expected to get it all up and running as there are many major parts to the
                project
                that we need to get perfected. </p>

            <p>The name, uniqueName and ID of the person who worked on the Task can be clearly shown in the JSON
                response. Once the story points are retrieved, we will store these in the Database alongside of
                the user ID so we can convert to experience points.<br><br>

                Hitting the API and getting the story points is one thing, we will need to give the ability for
                the web application to call the API every time a sprint is finished. This could be a manual
                button within the web app that send a request to the API for the story points or an automated
                response every time a sprint is finished in the Azure DevOps Kanban Board based on the end date
                of the sprint. The latter would be the preferred response but will need to be tested.<br><br>

                Calculating the Xp based on the story points is a simple calculation, but we will need to check
                that the Xp hasn’t been allocated to a user previously for that story. We will need to consume
                the API data within the Web application and using MVC .net core would be a good way to do this
                as its simple, lightweight and will allow for building and connecting to API’s.<br><br>

                Additionally, we will need to build an API from the Web application to the game itself so that Xp points
                can be consumed and used within the game. In addition, an API from the game to the ToDoTopia web
                application will be needed to allow information from the came to be stored in the ToDoTopia database
                such as leader board points and the cost of units in the game.<br><br>

                Below is an example of the web application database this does not include the game database itself.
