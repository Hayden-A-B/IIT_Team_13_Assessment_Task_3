            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>ToDoTopia is a web-based, games platform that links into companies’ productivity tools to determine
                in-game
                XP. Being a web-based application allows for more flexibility as it is easier to release updates and
                users
                are not required to install an application on their personal computer. Our original idea was to create a
                productivity tool that possessed gamification features, but after some research we decided to focus on
                making a more engaging gaming experience that links into already popular productivity tools, rather than
                focusing on building a productivity tool. Our goal for this platform is to create a more fun and
                competitive
                work environment by turning completed tasks into XP that can be used to buy troops, guns and other
                equipment
                in a real-time strategy (RTS) game. We want to encourage a time at the end of each week or sprint for
                employees to sit down, have a drink and verse each other in a battle that is highly influenced by the
                level
                of productivity of each individual during that week or sprint.<br><br>

                To link into productivity tools used by our customers (such as Jira and Azure DevOps) will require the
                use
                of an API. We will use this API to send across information related to the task such as its difficulty,
                size
                and who completes it. In ToDoTopia’s game, XP will be used to purchase troops, guns, tanks, etc.
                ToDoTopia
                will use the information received about the task to translate it to in-game XP. The task’s size will be
                used
                to determine how much XP the user will receive and the employee who completes the task or moves it to
                the
                next stage of progress will be awarded this XP. The overall outcome of this project is to create a
                web-based
                game’s platform that uses data from a company’s task manager (e.g., Jira or Azure DevOps) to allow
                employees
                to gain in-game XP by completing more tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p class="motivation">Gamification of tasks is not necessarily a new idea. Companies such as <a
                    href="https://habitica.com/static/home">Habitica</a> have been doing it for a
                while now in a way of making your daily tasks and activities rewarding by giving you a character who
                starts
                at level one and has no items. The idea is that you self-appoint yourself tasks and as you complete
                those
                tasks you are rewarded with better equipment to help your character progress. However, these
                applications
                are more on an individual basis and the game play is limited. Keeping a team motivated during a project
                can
                be difficult, but gamification has shown to keep the attention of employees and increase their
                productivity.
                What is gamification? Gamification at its core is turning work into play. There is a model known as
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Qjuegtiyc">Octalysis</a> that explains in detail the eight
                core drives that gamify something whether it be a task at
                work
                or a video game.<br><br>
                <strong>These eight core drives are as listed below:</strong> <br><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Epic Meaning and calling: </strong>“When a player believes that he is doing something
                    greater
                    than himself.”
                    (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Development and Accomplishment: </strong>“The internal drive of making progress, developing
                    skills, and
                    eventually overcoming challenges.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment and Creativity: </strong>“When users are engaged in a creative process where
                    they
                    have to repeatedly
                    figure things out and try different combinations.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral
                    Design)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ownership and Possession: </strong>“Where users are motivated because they feel like they
                    own
                    something. When a
                    player feels ownership, she innately wants to make what she owns better and own even more.” (Yu-kai
                    Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Social Influence and Relatedness: </strong>‘’This drive incorporates all the social elements
                    that drive people,
                    including: mentorship, acceptance, social responses, companionship, as well as competition and envy.
                    When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become
                    driven
                    to reach the same level” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Scarcity and Impatience: </strong>“The drive of wanting something because you can’t have it.
                    Many games have
                    Appointment Dynamics (come back 2 hours later to get your reward) – the fact that people can’t get
                    something right now motivates them to think about it all day long.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp;
                    Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Unpredictability: </strong>“Generally, this is a harmless drive of wanting to find out what
                    will
                    happen next.
                    If you don’t know what’s going to happen, your brain is engaged, and you think about it often. Many
                    people watch movies or read novels because of this drive. However, this drive is also the primary
                    factor
                    behind gambling addiction.” (Yu-kai Chou: Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>
                <li><strong>Loss and Avoidance: </strong>“Based upon the avoidance of something negative happening.”
                    (Yu-kai
                    Chou:
                    Gamification &amp; Behavioral Design)</li>

                <p>Every good game consists of these eight properties, and they can be used to motivate people and keep
                    them
                    focused. This is the motivation for ToDoTopia, to use gamification to turn completing tasks in a

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>The idea of gamifying tasks is already out there, and applications have been made that use this. <a
                    href="https://habitica.com/static/home">Habitica</a>
                is a habit tracking and task management app. It gamifies completing tasks and practicing habits by
                assigning tasks with gold. This gold is used to build up an avatar and a team can “battle” monsters by
                completing more tasks and habits. The “battle” in Habitica, however, does not require any gameplay,
                rather every day the monster is damaged until its health runs out.
                Other apps such as Todoist and Forest incorporate gamification into their app designs. Todoist is a
                well-known task manager for individuals and teams. It possesses gamification in the form of “Karma” and
                “Karma Levels”. As tasks are complete, the user obtains “Karma”, a form of XP or points, that builds up
                levels. Although Todoist is gamified, it doesn’t possess any true gameplay. Forest is a time-tracking
                application built for setting a timer when working on a particular task. Its gamification is in the form
                of an animated forest where each tree is a timer session. When a timer is completed, a tree is grown in
                the forest, but when the timer is stopped halfway through the session a dead tree is added to the
                forest.
                What ToDoTopia is offering that is different from all these apps, and any other application made with a
                similar purpose, is gameplay. ToDoTopia itself isn’t a task manager, or a Kanban board, but a web-based
                gaming platform allowing for actual gameplay. Actual gameplay is far more engaging than adding armour to
                an avatar or growing trees in a forest. Since our focus is on gameplay, we can create better games that
                link into already great productivity tools.

            <h1>Detailed Description</h1>
            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>The aim is to build a web-based application called ToDoTopia that links into workplace productivity, work
                in progress and time tracking applications to gamify Individual employee and team workloads. The main
                aim is to incentivize teams, help increase productivity, and to create a productive and competitive
                working environment. There are many goals we must work towards and achieve to fulfil our aim. The most
                important and crucial parts of our project can be put into goals. The main goals are to create the game,
                keeping employees motivated, where to host it and applying it to a web application. The creation of the
                game can be split up into smaller goals such as coding it on unity and also how we create the
                fundamentals of the game, so it provides a positive impact to the employees. These are the main goals,
                getting these up and running is of most importance, then we can hone down onto smaller goals for example
                fine tuning the game. </p>

            <h2>Creating the game</h2>
            <p>Creating the game is one of the biggest goals, it can be broken down into smaller goals based around the
                model known as Octalysis. Octalysis explains in detail the eight core drives that gamify something
                whether
                it be a task at work or a video game. These eight core drives are, Epic Meaning and calling, Development
                and
                Accomplishment, Empowerment and Creativity, Ownership and Possession, Social Influence and Relatedness,
                Scarcity and Impatience, Unpredictability and Loss and Avoidance. When creating the game our goal will
                be to
                include these eight properties. The goal is to create a real-time strategy game (RTS) where opponents
                play
                off against each other with their armies. Teams of three would be the aim, so games of 3v3, 2v2 or 1v1.
                We
                chose this as the thought of annihilating your co-worker(s) after a hard week of work would make for a
                great
                team winddown exercise on a Friday afternoon.</p>
            <h2>Keeping employees motivated</h2>
            <p>Another huge goal is to make sure our platform keeps employees motivated, enthused to clear workloads and
                stay in touch with deadlines. By creating the game, we aim to provide a platform for employees to engage
                each other in a social environment. We want the game to provide an outlet for employees to have fun,
                which
                will result in a better, more productive and a more connected workplace. To keep employees motivated we
                will
                implement an experience points system into the game. The goal is to create a system where employees will
                gain Xp when completing tasks, depending on the size of the task determines the amount of Xp acquired.
                Showing how much Xp a task is worth is a good idea so that employees or teams will try and smash out a
                higher-level task to gain this Xp. Xp can be used to buy units in the game. Employees will be trying to
                complete higher tasks as fast as possible to gain more troops than fellow employees, creating an
                efficient
                work environment.
            </p>
            <h2>Web application </h2>
            <p>The goal is to make web application the main platform. We want to It to be a cloud-based application that
                will host the computer game, this will be the main space for ToDoTopia. We will have to choose what to
                host
                It on, such as AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. The goal is to use GameLift cloud-based game
                servers
                which are dedicated for multiplayer games. This will allow us to easily scale depending on how many
                companies are going to employ the game. </p>

            <h2>Do we have enough Time/Recourses?</h2>
            <p>There will be many resources needed to complete this project, along with a lot of time. Most of the time
                will
                be going into the actual creation of the game, as well as where it's going to be hosted and getting our
                name
                out there. I think we will have enough manpower to complete the project. It will come down to if we have
                enough funding to use the cloud services, advertising as well as if we need to employ any IT specialists
                to
                help with the programming of the game, as well as the data side of things. All this will take a lot of
                time,
                it might take longer than expected to get it all up and running as there are many major parts to the
                project
                that we need to get perfected. </p>

            <p>The name, uniqueName and ID of the person who worked on the Task can be clearly shown in the JSON
                response. Once the story points are retrieved, we will store these in the Database alongside of
                the user ID so we can convert to experience points.<br><br>

                Hitting the API and getting the story points is one thing, we will need to give the ability for
                the web application to call the API every time a sprint is finished. This could be a manual
                button within the web app that send a request to the API for the story points or an automated
                response every time a sprint is finished in the Azure DevOps Kanban Board based on the end date
                of the sprint. The latter would be the preferred response but will need to be tested.<br><br>

                Calculating the Xp based on the story points is a simple calculation, but we will need to check
                that the Xp hasn’t been allocated to a user previously for that story. We will need to consume
                the API data within the Web application and using MVC .net core would be a good way to do this
                as its simple, lightweight and will allow for building and connecting to API’s.<br><br>

                Additionally, we will need to build an API from the Web application to the game itself so that Xp points
                can be consumed and used within the game. In addition, an API from the game to the ToDoTopia web
                application will be needed to allow information from the came to be stored in the ToDoTopia database
                such as leader board points and the cost of units in the game.<br><br>

                Below is an example of the web application database this does not include the game database itself.

        <div id="Look" class="tabcontent">
            <h1>What the Web App Will Look Like</h1>
            <h2>Home Page</h2>
            <p>The web app of ToDoTopia, which will be accessed through the domain todotopia.com, is the place users
                will set up their accounts, deal with XP, check leaderboards and open games. These games will be hosted
                separately, but will link to the web app. The home page of ToDoTopia, once the user is signed in, will
                display the team they are in, their recent activity in the companies chosen Work-In-Progress platform
                (starting with Azure DevOps), their current XP, an up-to-date leaderboard for the team and company and a
                menu that allows the user to navigate the web app. At its core, the ToDoTopia web app home page will be
                an overview of the user’s current statistics and activity in their WIP application. Users will not be
                able to edit or complete tasks from ToDoTopia, but will be able to view the tasks and their relevant
                properties.</p>

            <h2>Dashboard</h2>
            <p>The dashboard will be opened from the home page of ToDoTopia’s web app via the menu and will display the
                user’s recent activity in greater detail and the user’s current XP. In the dashboard, the user will be
                able to assign XP to their game of choice as there will be multiple games in the future of ToDoTopia.
                However, in the first version of ToDoTopia there will be only one game and this step of assigning XP to
                a chosen game will be automated. When the user decides to use their XP to purchase in-game items (such
                as troops, tanks, planes, etc.), they will be required to open the game via the games menu from the home
                page of the web app.</p>

            <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
            <p>The home page will display the leaderboard of the user’s team. When opened, the user will be able
                interact with leaderboard items. These items are the users and their current XP. The user will also be
                able to filter the leaderboard by their team and company, and possibly teams in a specific department of
                the company if the company has set up their account in such a way. IT teams will be displayed in the
                leaderboard as well as individuals. This will allow the company to check on how teams are performing
                against each other. The leaderboard of the web app will only be sorted with the data from the WIP Kanban
                board and not the games. If the user would like to view how each member is performing in a game, they
                will be required to open the games menu and click on the specific game’s leaderboard. This will display
                the leaderboard for that game based on battles won, XP lost, etc.

            </p>
            <h2>Admin</h2>
            <p>Admin will be a page of ToDoTopia only accessible to the team leader who created the team account. Other
                team members will not have the option to view this page. The admin page will be where the team leader
                can set defaults for how XP will be assigned. They will be able to enter an amount of XP per story
                point. Some teams will use 5 story points, and others might use 10, so the web app will be developed to
                incorporate the team’s style. An example could look like this: 1 SP (story point) = 10 XP, 2 SP = 25 XP,
                3 SP = 50XP, 4 SP = 100 XP, and 5 SP = 200 XP. These numbers will be different for every team and can be
                changed at any time only by the team leader.<br><br>
                In the Admin page, the team leader will also be able to modify the cost of in-game items. The user will
                be required to select the game, then the items in that game will be listed with the corresponding XP
                required to purchase that item. The team leader will be able to enter a new amount per item at any time,
                allowing for the cost of troops, tanks, planes, etc. to be based on the team’s story points style.

                used to modify account details (email, password, username (used by each game), bio, etc.). When a new
                member is added to the Kanban board, their account will be automatically created. This allows for XP to
                immediately be sent to their account when a task is completed. For this to happen, ToDoTopia will take
                the new user’s email from DevOps and create a temporary password to be emailed to the user. The email
                will direct the user to change the temporary password and finish setting up their account by choosing a
                unique username and adding a bio and some social links.</p>

        <div id="Built" class="tabcontent">
            <h1>How the Web App will be Built</h1>
            <h2>.NET Framework</h2>
            <p>There are dozens of frameworks we can choose from to create the web app and games. Our games will be
                developed using Unity game engine and the language C#. Our web app will be developed using <a
                    href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps">ASP.NET Core</a>
                which is a framework that uses the languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C# to programme a web app. We
                will be required to learn these languages and have already started on this journey as we have used HTML,
                CSS and a bit of JavaScript to create a simple website hosted on GitHub. Razor will also be used and is
                any file with the suffix .cshtml. Razor is a server-side markup language that is a combination of HTML
                and C#. ASP.NET Core also allows for the creation of APIs which will be needed to transmit data from the
                web app to the games and vice versa.</p>

                <div class="zoom"><img class="techMap" src="Images/.netcore.jpg" alt="TechnologyMap"></div>

            <h2>Connecting to Azure DevOps (and Jira) through API</h2>
            <p>ToDoTopia’s web app will constantly be ‘communicating’ with Azure DevOps in the backend on the server
                side by sending a get request through an API to the DevOps Kanban board used by the team. Data will be
                returned to the web app and entered into its databases. If tasks are completed, then that data will run
                through some functions which will be programmed to calculate the amount of XP to be assigned and who to
                assign it to. All this will happen in the backend on the server side and the results will be displayed
                in the user’s browser. The web app itself will receive updates about XP using AJAX (Asynchronous
                JavaScript and XML) with the data in the format of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
                When tasks are added in the DevOps Kanban board, they will be sent to ToDoTopia’s databases through an
                API. Before being saved to the database, a programme will run, turning the storypoints from the task
                into XP based on the team leader’s settings in Admin. This data will sit in the database until the task
                is completed or moved into a new stage of progression (In Progress, Ready for Review, Complete, etc.).
                When these changes are made to the task in the Kanban board, the XP will be assigned to the user who
                changed it and saved to a new database. If a task is moved back in a stage of progression (e.g. Complete
                to In Progress), that XP will be subtracted from the user’s ToDoTopia account and moved back to the
                unassigned XP database.
            </p>
            <h2>Connecting to Game through API (to transfer XP data)</h2>
            <p>ToDoTopia’s games will be hosted separate from the web app and will receive data about XP via an API. At
                the start of a match/battle in a game, the game will send a final get request to the web app before
                freezing XP updates to the game. This freezing allows users to purchase any items and play the game
                without any interference from tasks being changed in the DevOps Kanban board. After the match/battle,
                the game will update XP data in the databases based on the results of the match/battle. Any XP that was
                used to purchase in-game items will be subtracted from the user’s total XP and any XP won in-game will
                be added to the user’s XP and be viewable in the web app.</p>

            <h2>User Interface</h2>
            <p>The UI can also be created in unity a long with the game. Unity provides three UI systems that we can use
                to create our user interfaces for games made in unity editor. These three UI systems are a UI toolkit,
                uGUI and IMGUI.
                The UI Toolkit is used to create extensions for the Unity Editor and is also used to create runtime UI
                for games and applications. The toolkit contains a retained-mode UI system, this system contains the
                features and functionality required to create user interfaces. UI asset types that have been inspired by
                popular standard web formats such as CSS, XML and HTML. These can be used to structure and to style the
                user interface to our liking. The toolkit also contains recourses we can use to learn how to use the UI
                Toolkit. It will teach us how to create and debug the interface we create.<br><br>
                The Unity User Interface package (uGUI) is a game-based UI system that we can use to create runtime UI
                for our RTS game. The uGUI package allows us to take advantage of advanced rendering and text features.
                It will allow us to arrange, position and style the UI.<br><br>

                The Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface (IMGUI) will allow us to use the OnGUI function and scripts
                that we can use to draw and manage the user interface. IMGUI will also allow us to create custom
                inspectors for extensions for the Unity Editor, script components and in-game debugging displays.

            <h2>How does the game save data and keep all data up to date? </h2>
            <p>ToDoTopia will be a web-based game that will use a cloud service (AWS/Azure) to manage all of our in-game
                data requirements, allowing you to view all of your game data from any device and from anywhere.<br><br>

                Cloud saves is a feature that allows games and platforms that require saving game files to use cloud
                storage. This feature covers everything from in-game progress storage to settings, purchases, and
                profiles. In-game purchases are a typical feature of today's digital gaming, and they demand payment
                using game credits, which are frequently purchased with real money. Because the data is saved on the
                cloud, the account information provided for this purpose is protected from being erased or
                breached.<br><br>

                When a gaming session finishes, cloud saves are an automated process that synchronises the saved data
                from the game to cloud storage. To prevent gaming frauds cloud, the player is required to manually
                upload the locally saved game data to the ui if there is an issue during this sync. Another alternative
                is to resume the sync by downloading previously saved game data from the cloud.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Benefits of Cloud saves</h2>
            <p>With huge volumes of data being kept on the cloud, the ability to save and synchronise data through cloud
                storage has become a requirement in our life. Although the free space in smartphones, computers, and
                gaming consoles makes customers happy, the benefits of cloud storage disappear when the service
                experiences technical difficulties or fails to function effectively.<br><br>

                For instances where the gamer wants to play alone without connecting to servers for multiplayer mode,
                the sync will simply not happen. Also, when they want to show off their in-game achievements to a friend
                and the location doesn’t offer sufficient internet, the game progress that is indicated might not be
                completely updated. For these reasons, cloud saves come in handy when accessing games through different
                platforms, internet speeds, and locations.

            <h1>Project story</h1>
            <h2>How it Began:</h2>
            <p>The inception of ToDoTopia began with Jesse Watson’s first assignment for RMIT’s Introductory IT
                course.<br><br>

                In an independent project he researched the viability and real-world applications of gamification and
                how it can be used to increase productivity and maintaining a higher level of motivation to carry out
                tasks. The concept comes from visualizing a fusion between gamification to-do lists like <a
                    href="https://habitica.com/static/home">Habitica</a> which
                is an individual centric gamified to-do list application, and <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a>
                a more group centric application
                with a professional UI. The idea at this stage was to have the completed tasks award points which would
                subsequently display as a village or character which then acquires better equipment, or the town’s size
                and quality would improve.<br><br>

                This concept became the idea with which we as Team Thirteen from RMIT chose to further develop in the
                endeavour of creating a product which would fill an unchartered territory which is gamification in a
                work environment. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>How it has Progressed:</h2>
            <p>Having realised that the concept of gamifying a to-do list for individuals was a well traversed territory
                we subsequently opted to venture into an untapped market which is workplace gamification.
                After discussing the goals for project ToDoTopia, we at Team Thirteen decided that we would like to
                design a game that linked workplace assigned tasks to a rewards system that would allow users to
                accumulate points that are distributed on completion of tasks, the number of points distributed will be
                controlled by the organisations designated administrators. Organisations that use ToDoTopia will have
                the ability to customize many aspects of the game and its web application to further personalize it to
                their requirements and preferences.<br><br>

                We settled upon using Unity as the engine for the game, as it has a wide range of tools which will
                assist us greatly in building our game.
                From research on the game engine Unity, we found that to begin developing with it is free until revenue
                and funding exceeds 100k USD as described on their <a
                    href="https://store.unity.com/compare-plans">website</a>, therefore we don’t need to worry about
                buying the software until we start to make a profit from the game. As we develop the game further, we
                may find limitations in the free Unity package and may need to consider purchasing one of the premium
                options.<br><br>

                The internet would be used to host our Unity game, whilst utilising cloud storage for both the HTML page
                and Unity game.
                Our goal is to have a web application serve as the core for the project ToDoTopia. While the web app
                will be where the tasks are completed for points and the game portion will be where the rewards are
                utilised in gameplay, we hope to expand on the number of ways you can use rewards by adding new games
                linked to the rewards system, establishing a connection with pre-existing rewards systems like Flybuy or
                Woolworths points for example, or even offering company perks or bonuses based on ranking in a company
                leaderboard.<br><br>

                The task system would be deployed on an Azure DevOps Kanban board system and connected via API.
                Team Thirteen doesn’t have a lot of experience using Azure DevOps, Kanban boards, or APIs so more
                research will need to be undertaken to finalise this plan, we may find we can even implement features
                for Scrum boards and other niche boards. At this stage we have decided to pursue using a Kanban board
                hosted with Azure DevOps <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/devops/boards/">Boards</a>
                which will connect to the game via an API service like <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to
                allow them both to interconnect their experience points and rewards systems.
                Conclusion: ToDoTopia has undergone significant improvements since its conception, though a lot of
                planning and learning is still required before we can make a start on developing ToDoTopia into the
                product that we have envisioned.

                <h2>What Stage are we at with the Project:</h2>
                <p>We have laid out the framework for our development and learning plan for building ToDoTopia, with a
                    large emphasis being placed upon the learning path and prioritisation of skills we will need for
                    development.<br><br>

                    In consideration of the fact that many of us in Team Thirteen lack the technical skills and
                    knowledge to undertake the building of the game in Unity, we have instead focused our attention on
                    planning the games features, the tools we need to generate these features, any software
                    infrastructure required, also any skills and talents we will need to develop.<br><br>

                    We’ve created concept pieces for the game’s UI and described what the finished product will look
                    like along with the modes we will first develop for the game. We aim to release game modes
                    individually to maintain a minimum viable product through development and expand upon our offered
                    services over time. We’ve discussed using a subscription fee model as the games form of
                    monetization, subscription fees will allow us to charge a modest sum during our early stages of
                    development where our offering of game modes may be meagre. As our services diversify, we can always
                    raise our subscription fee, this eliminates any lost revenue from selling a one-time purchase game
                    license for a low price then adding a multitude of features then raising the price.<br><br>

                    Due to our deficiencies in software development and game design we have not made substantial
                    progress in the material development of the ToDoTopia’s game or web application components, instead
                    we have only created concepts and elaborated on our plan to build the project.

                    <h2>Any Dead Ends we have come Across:</h2>
                    <p>There are a few areas in which we are lacking such as our programming, artistic, and sound
                        editing abilities. Listed here is just a few of our shortcomings but are our most critical
                        issues or issues without simple resolutions.<br><br>

                        Our programming ability is largely rudimentary at this stage which prevents us from creating a
                        game with our own code at this stage. To overcome this deficit, we will need to dedicate time to learning programming languages like
                        C#, C++, or JavaScript for our required applications for use with Unity and its toolkits we
                        intend to use. Over time, as we learn more about programming and Unity, we might discover
                        applications that are more suitable to our needs and thus may need to learn to use any new
                        software and languages as well.<br><br>

                        To learn these programming languages there are many excellent free resources available online or
                        we could opt to enrol in a paid bootcamp for learning to code. One of the free resources
                        available are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> which provides learning materials for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">JavaScript</a> and many of the most
                        popular programming languages such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php">C#</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp">C++</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">Python</a> and more. Then secondly there is
                        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">FreeCodeCamp</a> which presently offers 12 free certification courses to choose from, ranging from
                        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/">Back-End Development and APIs</a> to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/">Scientific Computing with Python</a> to name a couple. Utilising
                        free learning resources and development software will help us greatly along the way as it will
                        likely be a long road towards making ToDoTopia into a profitable service.<br><br>

                        Artistic talent is another area in which we lack, Team Thirteen was formed from students
                        enrolled in an Introductory IT course so naturally the chances of it being a field of experience
                        was slim.<br><br>

                        We will need to develop the art related aspects of both our web application and the game itself.
                        For the web application we will need to learn more about UI &amp; UX design to increase user
                        satisfaction with our products, this design could be undertaken by any of us after having
                        studied UI &amp; UX design either at RMIT, FreeCodeCamp provides a course on Front-End Development
                        which could be a useful resource for one or more of us to study to ensure a smooth user
                        interaction with our web application.<br><br>

                        We will also need someone with the ability to create concept art, game art, animations, and
                        visual effects to name just a few. These are skills we absolutely do not have presently and
                        therefore cannot develop the art of the game unless we were to use premade resources provided
                        within Unity, or one of Team Thirteens members chose to specialise in artistic design, or we
                        recruit outside help from someone with art design skills.<br><br>

                        James Costello has shown an aptitude for using Adobe Photoshop to produce visual elements used
                        in the creation of our assessment webpages, UI &amp; UX may be an avenue James wishes to further his
                        skills in for the project.<br><br>

                        Hayden Bleys also has qualifications in Visual Arts, which may serve as a starting point to
                        further his education in Art Design for games and become a Technical Artist.<br><br>

                        Reflecting upon our shortcomings in the art design area allows us to see that we need someone to
                        be take on learning so that they can specialise in UI &amp; UX as it is one of the most critical
                        aspects. We also now know that one issue we will need to address before we advance with the
                        production of ToDoTopia is our lack of Art Design skills.
