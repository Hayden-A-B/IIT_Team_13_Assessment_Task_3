     <h1>Team Review of Assignment 2</h1>

        <p>
            Five weeks ago, we got together and formed Team Thirteen, a group of 6 individuals who had never met each other and from all different fields of work, backgrounds, and ages. Our task was to create a website and a PDF document based on our team profile and presenting our project idea ToDoTopia, A project to combine work with games to take the gruel out of everyday work task and activities. Once we all settled into the group, we came up with a game plan and started assigning task and assembling our assignment.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Overall, we believe as a team we have achieved a lot in a small amount and have produced a pdf and website that are to industry standards regarding presentation and appeal. Like in all team projects there were high moments and low moments from disagreements to miscommunication, but we came together and finished the project strong.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A few things that went well for us was our website design and overall presentation, one of our team members has a strong background in web design which pushed us to create something that would normally be out of our depths. We all challenged ourselves and came out of this assignment with a strong understanding of website design. Another positive was getting to experience the whole procedure of working as a team, it has allowed us to see were our strong points and weak points are, allowing us to move forward to our next assignment with a strong understanding on were to focus our time and efforts.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A major issue that seemed to arise several times during the assignment was communication, a good example of the lack of communication was task being or not being completed. When people were assigned a task, they were not informing others about their progress leaving the team in the dark and by doing so causing time management issues. As mentioned above moving forward we know that communication is a factor that we will need to focus on in our next assignment.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One thing that really took us a team by surprise was the quality of work that we have achieved together, with our combined efforts we have created a strong website as well as a promising project idea that we intend to keep working on even after our assignments are through as we believe there is great potential for the overall product/idea.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Coming out of the assignment we have also made some strong professional relationships with each other and as we all move through our different career paths will stay in contact and help each other and share information, ideas etc. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We as a team are proud of what we have achieved and look forward moving onto the next project.
