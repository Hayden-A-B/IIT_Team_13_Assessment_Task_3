     <h1>Processes and Communication</h1> 
        
        <p>
            Communication in our team is crucial to the success of the project. We communicate through Microsoft Teams in the form of posts, direct messages, and video calls. Our two weekly meetings are very important as they help us determine the course of the project. These meetings are every Monday and Friday at 5pm AEDT. It is very important that every member of our team attends the video call with their cameras on and has their say in the conversation. Although these are our only set meetings, we always have at least one other meeting during the week. Wednesdays are quite often our midweek meeting even though they arenâ€™t required, but they help us greatly on the advancement of our project. One on one video calls throughout the week are quite common when a member needs help on a task, or two or more people are working on a task together. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The process in which we distributed tasks was based on the Kanban Board. Using Microsoft Teams task board we created a backlog of tasks that needed completing and each weeks Monday meeting we assigned each team member one or two tasks for the week and reviewed on Friday. This allowed us to prioritise works in progress for a steady work flow.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If a member is going to fail to complete their tasks on time it is expected that they reach out beforehand to ask for help. If members fail to show up to our two weekly meetings and do not let us know beforehand, or they continually do not attend, we make sure to reach out. If this does not work, we are required to mention this to the tutor and reassign the tasks given to them. Luckily, we have not run into such a big problem and our members are all communicating well.

    <!-- A2 Review -->    
     <h1>Team Review of Assignment 2</h1>

        <p>
            Five weeks ago, we got together and formed Team Thirteen, a group of 6 individuals who had never met each other and from all different fields of work, backgrounds, and ages. Our task was to create a website and a PDF document based on our team profile and presenting our project idea ToDoTopia, A project to combine work with games to take the gruel out of everyday work task and activities. Once we all settled into the group, we came up with a game plan and started assigning task and assembling our assignment.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Overall, we believe as a team we have achieved a lot in a small amount and have produced a pdf and website that are to industry standards regarding presentation and appeal. Like in all team projects there were high moments and low moments from disagreements to miscommunication, but we came together and finished the project strong.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A few things that went well for us was our website design and overall presentation, one of our team members has a strong background in web design which pushed us to create something that would normally be out of our depths. We all challenged ourselves and came out of this assignment with a strong understanding of website design. Another positive was getting to experience the whole procedure of working as a team, it has allowed us to see were our strong points and weak points are, allowing us to move forward to our next assignment with a strong understanding on were to focus our time and efforts.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A major issue that seemed to arise several times during the assignment was communication, a good example of the lack of communication was task being or not being completed. When people were assigned a task, they were not informing others about their progress leaving the team in the dark and by doing so causing time management issues. As mentioned above moving forward we know that communication is a factor that we will need to focus on in our next assignment.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One thing that really took us a team by surprise was the quality of work that we have achieved together, with our combined efforts we have created a strong website as well as a promising project idea that we intend to keep working on even after our assignments are through as we believe there is great potential for the overall product/idea.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Coming out of the assignment we have also made some strong professional relationships with each other and as we all move through our different career paths will stay in contact and help each other and share information, ideas etc. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We as a team are proud of what we have achieved and look forward moving onto the next project.
